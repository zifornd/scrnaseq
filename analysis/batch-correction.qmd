Load Bioconductor package(s):

```{r}
library(batchelor)
```

Read experiment object(s):

```{r}
sce <- readRDS("object.rds")
```

```{r}
PARAM <- FastMnnParam(
    BSPARAM = BSP, 
    BNPARAM = BNP, 
    BPPARAM = BPP
)
```

```{r}
dec <- lapply(sce, metadata)
```

```{r}
mnn <- quickCorrect(sce, PARAM = PARAM, precomputed = dec)
```

Save experiment object:

```{r}
saveRDS(mnn, file = "output/batch-correction.rds")
```

Print session information:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
